I am submitting a manuscript entitled "What constrains distributional learning
in adults?" for consideration for publication in _Cognition_.  This manuscript
is original, not previously published, and not under concurrent consideration
anywhere else.

This manuscript addresses an apparent puzzle: why, if both language acquisition
and adaptation in adults can both be seen as forms of distributional or
statistical learning, is it so hard to learn a new language as an adult?  If
distributional learning really is a process that operates continuously
throughout the lifespan, what explains the loss of flexibility in adulthood?  In
four experiments (including one computational model), I present evidence that
suggests that adult listeners' distributional learning is constrained by their
prior experience with other talkers.  These experiments show (1) that
distributional learning of the cue to word-initial voicing (e.g., "beach"
vs. "peach") in American English speaking adults _is_ constrained, with less
learning of cue distributions that deviate more from a typical talker of
American English; (2) that these constraints are not due to the "unsupervised"
nature of distributional learning (where speech sounds are presented in an
ambiguous, minimal pair context); (3) that these constraints are consistent with
Bayesian belief updating starting from shared prior beliefs about phonetic cue
distributions that are very similar to those produced by a typical talker of
American English; and (4) that there is even less learning of distributions that
deviate even more strongly from a typical talker.  Together, these results
suggest that the apparent discontinuity in flexibility in language processing
between acquisition and adulthood may in fact result from the continuous
operation of distributional learning at _multiple levels_, from distributional
learning of the sensory cues for linguistic units (phonemes, words, etc.) to
learning of the range of variation in these distributions that a listener
encounters across the many talkers they encounter.

Please note that this manuscript describes work that was drawn from my 2016
dissertation which was supervised by Florian Jaeger.  Dr. Jaeger has declined
authorship of this manuscript, for reasons unrelated to the content.

This manuscript contains about 13,000 words (with about 1,800 more in figure
captions).  I have submitted the PDF of the paper and supplementary information,
as well as the RMarkdown source files for each, which contains the text along
with the code required to reproduce the analyses and generate the manuscript and
supplementary information, which may be useful to reviewers.  Additionally,
there is an OSF repository ([osf.io/3wdp2/](https://osf.io/3wdp2/))
which contains these source files as well as binary files of the output of the
various Bayesian models reported in the text which can be time consuming to fit.
