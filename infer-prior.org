** follow-up modeling analyses

*** DONE re-analyse results with incremental model

    I've run this model but I haven't looked at the results, buried in
    ~beliefupdatr~ somewhere?  IN particular, want to know what the inferred prior
    looks like.

*** joint fits to expts 1 and 3 (two mean)

    This might be hard because of the different structures ot these
    datasets...1 is just exposure, but 3 has a separate post-test.

*** how much does assuming labels known hurt us?

    run forward simulations based on inferred prior with unsupervised algorithm
    (particles).  In lieu of actually doing the full unsupervised prior inferring,
    see how far off we are.

*** additional models

    control model: just change lapse rate (maybe)

    use production means/variances and just fit confidence.  how well does it
    explain adaptation?

*** DONE consider only analyzing positive VOT shifts
    only have positive shfits for supervised ones...and maybe it simplifies
    things somewhat.

**** considerations
     the issue is that the data from the other experiment starts to look weird
     then since there's no negative VOT shifts...but negative VOTs are weird
     anyway so maybe it's best to just stay away from those altogether.

     but then it feels a little icky to withold data just because it's
     conceptually tricky/makes for a less clean story.  I mean it's probably
     fine to just say "okay negative VOTs are weird but leaving that aside let's
     see what happens".  THen again it also doesn't go AGAINST any story I'm
     trying to tell, it's just not super clear what relevance it has to
     anything.

**** Update
     [[file:models/inc_model.R::#'%20Okay%20what%20am%20I%20seeing%20here?%20the%20fit%20looks%20_more_%20like%20a%20"scale"%20solution][summary and plots]]

     Okay, so I did this.  And the inferred prior changes from a "shift" to a
     "scale" (less confidence in variance than mean).  The fit to all five
     conditions actually has like 80/20 split in the samples, so it's not
     *super* surprising but it's a little troubling that the "headline" changes
     so much.

     I kind of wish I didn't know this; now I have to decide which to report.
     It seems pretty clear that no matter _what_ I'll have to add the caveat
     that the fits are different.  But I'm not so sure what to make of the
     difference.  Is it actually important?  Just a basic instability in the
     model?

   """
* DONE decide which data goes in this paper
  One of the issues I keep coming back to is the question of *which data to
  discuss in this paper*.  A priori, my strong preferences is *all of it*.

  There are two main sticking points for me:
  1. The -10 /b/ VOT condition was added after the fact, and there's only
     unsupervised data on that one.  So if the supervised data is included,
     there's a discrepancy.
  2. If the -10 condition is excluded from the belief updating model, the
     inferred prior changes, in a rather dramatic way: switches from a "shift"
     (lower mean confidence) to a "scale" (lower var confidence) solution.

  I actually don't think *1.* is that big of a deal: learning in the large
  positive shifts is also incomplete, so the supervised conditions still provide
  a reasonable test of the hypothesis that what's blocking learning is the lack
  of labels.

  And *2.* is only a problem inasmuch as the goal is to draw strong conclusions
  based on the content of the inferred prior.  I think it's really better as a
  sanity check here: _can_ the constraints we see be explained by belief
  updating based on a common starting point??  Either way the answer is gonna be
  yes (there's no reason that the fits to a restricted subset of the data would
  fit _worse_ on those data than a fit to a superset).

  So there's no reason to give up my prior preferences to include all the data.
  Just need to be honest about how the data was collected and the caveats about
  the interpretation of the inferred prior.  But there are already _lots_ of
  caveates needed there anyway (assuming direct access to the statistical
  properties of the clusters/labels are known, constraints on the confidence
  parameters being equal across categories, etc.).  So.

  *decision*: experiment 1 is all conditions.  experiment 2 is all supervised
  (which doesn't include -10 shift).  modeling is all conditions from
  experiment 1.  experiment 3 is all experiment 3 conditions
* Outline

** Intro
  
*** Lots of flexibility in adult language

    recal, dist learning, etc.

*** what _are_ the constraints?

*** goal

    systematically explore a range of distributions that vary in their similarity
    to a typical talker's distributions; see what (English-speaking) adults
    manage to learn and what they do not.

    In this paper I explore a simple hypothesis: people a harder time learning
    distributions that are less similar to the distributions that they've
    previously encountered.  
    
*** preview

    people have a harder time adapting to distributions that deviate a lot from
    what's typical of American English.  This happens even in the presence of
    labeling information that tells them which VOTs are /b/ and which are /p/.

    The pattern of adaptation across conditions is consistent with statistically
    optimal distributional learning starting from a shared set of prior beliefs,
    and the shared prior beliefs are reasonably similar to what a typical talker
    of American English produces.
    
** Experiment 1
   
   A bunch of VOT distributions which vary in terms of similarity to standard
   American English VOT distributions.  Only going to vary the means of these
   distributions (keep things tractable).

*** Results

*** Discussion    

    Distributional learning is incomplete: in more extreme conditions, produced
    boundaries don't get all the way to the ideal boundary for the exposure
    distributions.  

    Why?

    One possible explanation: "shrinkage" towards a typical talker's boundary.

    Another possible explanation: this is an unsupervised task, so maybe
    listeners aren't picking up on the underlying distributions.  Test that in
    Experiment 2

** Experiment 2

   Same distributions, but half the trials are labeled.  Always one voiced and
   one voiceless, but on labeled trials the options are not minimal pairs, so
   only one is a plausible option.

*** Results

    Are boundaries different with supervision?

    Still don't get all the way there, even with supervised teaching signal.

*** Discussion

    Suggests that the constraint comes from something about the distributions
    themselves.  As above, one possible source is prior experience with a
    typical talker.  Explore this possibility with modeling.

** Modeling

   two questions: is the pattern of adaptation consistent with distributional
   Learning starting from a single (shared) set of prior beliefs?  And if so,
   are those shared prior beliefs similar to what a typical talker of American
   English produces?

   Model belief updating process.  Because we didn't find large differences
   between the supervised and unsupervised conditions, we're going to treat this
   as a supervised learning process because it's /much/ simpler to model.


** Experiment 3

** Discussion   

*** Ideal adapter: learn where to be flexible
    Under this interpretation, people don't become less flexible _per se_ as
    they enter adulthood.  Rather, they become _smarter_ about where to be
    flexible, because this allows them to learn more efficiently.

* notes/snippets

** Another intro
   One of the basic facts about human language is that a neurotypical human
   infant can learn any of the many and varied languages spoken on Earth.  That
   is, the language system is incredibly flexible during development.  However,
   at a certain point people lose the ability to learn other languages to
   native-like proficiency.  Nevertheless, recent research has shown that adults
   still remain the ability to learn new variants of their _native_ language.
   That is, the language system seems to remain plastic at least into adulthood,
   even if the form of this plasticity changes.
  
   One of the most remarkable forms of plasticity in adult speech perception is
   /distributional learning/.  Listeners adjust their representations of phonetic
   categories with mere exposure to distributions of acoustic stimuli.  This
   occurs without explicit instruction or labels.

   Suggests that listeners are closely attuned to the statistical patterns in
   their language environment, and pick up on changes in these contingencies to
   more effectively recover a talker's intended message from noisy, variable, and
   ambiguous acoustic signals.

   A comprehensive understanding of distributional learning requires that we
   understand not only how and when it does happen but also how and when it does
   _not_ happen, or is only incomplete.  That goal of this paper is to
   systematically probe the limits of distributional learning for speech in one
   phonetic system: word-initial stop voicing in American English.


   This paper addresses the /limits/ of distributional learning in adults.  What
   sort of speech statistics can adult speakers of American English /not/ learn?

** Framing
   What are all the things in play here?

*** TODO flesh out text here and paste into intro

*** acquisition: lots of flexibility there!
    A basic fact of human language is that any typically developing human infant
    can learn any human language.  Human languages vary dramatically at every
    level, including the basic sound systems they use, and the human language
    faculty must be flexible enough to deal with this substantial
    cross-linguistic variability.  The first stages of language acquistion are
    characterized by initial flexibility, which declines over development as the
    particulars of the native language are acquired.  For instance, as infants
    become better at discriminating linguistically important sounds in their
    native language, they simultaneously /lose/ the ability to discriminate
    sounds that are important for other languages but not their native language
    [@Best1995; @Kuhl1992; @Werker1984].  Ultimately, people become sufficiently
    inflexible over development that they generally struggle to learn another
    language in adulthood [@Hartshorne2018].

*** remarkable flexibility in adult language
    However, adult listeners still need to deal with substantial variability
    /within/ their native language, as talkers differ in how they realize the
    phonetic categories of the language using acoustic cues [e.g. @Allen2003;
    @Newman2001; @Clopper2005].  Accordingly, adult listeners flexibly adapt to
    unfamiliar talkers in a wide variety of contexts.  At one extreme,
    perception of heavily accented non-native talkers becomes faster and more
    accurate with just a few minutes of exposure [@Clarke-Davidson2004;
    @Bradlow2008; @Baese-berk2013].  At the other extreme, listeners recalibrate
    representations of individual phonetic categories based on subtle changes in
    single segments in otherwise unaccented talkers [@Kraljic2006; @Norris2003;
    @Bertelson2003].
    
*** distributional learning
    Both acquisition and adaptation have been theorized to be forms of
    distributional learning.  First, computational modeling shows that
    both acquisition [@McMurray2010; @Vallabha2007; @Feldman2013; but see
    @Hitczenko2018] and rapid adaptation [@Kleinschmidt2015b] can be treated as
    forms of distributional learning.  At some level, acquisition simply /is/ a
    problem of distributional learning, in the sense that ((( computational
    level analysis??  it IS a problem of distributional learning )))

    Second, both adults and infants are sensitive to distributional properties
    of speech.  One set of findings shows that listeners (both infants and
    adults) become more sensitive after exposure to a bimodal distribution of an
    acoustic cue (like length, voice-onset time, vowel formant frequencies,
    etc.) compared with exposure to a unimodal distribution [e.g. @Escudero2011;
    Goudbeek2008; @Maye2000; @Maye2002; @Feldman2013b].  Another set of findings
    shows that adult listeners can adapt to changes in the means and/or
    variances of the cue distributions for known phonetic categories [e.g.,
    @Clayards2008; @Theodore2015; @Theodore2019; @Colby2018; @Chladkova2017].
    What both of these sets of findings have in common is that listeners pick up
    on the distributions of cues without any explicit instruction about the
    itended category label associated with each token.  For example,
    @Clayards2008 had listeners listen to /b/-/p/ minimal pair words (e.g.,
    "beach/peach") with different voice-onset times (VOT), and click on a
    matching picture to indicate which member of the minimal pair they heard.
    On every trial, the VOT was drawn from one of two bimodal distributions,
    which had clusters with the same means but different variances across
    subjects.  Listeners in the high-variance condition produced shallower
    categorization functions, reflecting greater uncertainty associated with the
    wider range of VOTs they heard for each cluster.
    
*** clear constraints on what adults can learn
    If both acquisition and adaptation can be treated as forms of distributional
    learning, and both infants and adults are sensitive to distributional
    information, what distinguishes acquisition from adaptation?  For one, it
    seems that distributional learning in adults is /constrained/.  Adult
    listeners struggle to learn new categories that are not present in their
    native language.  For instance, Japanese listeners struggle to discriminate
    the English /r/-/l/ contrast, which corresponds a single category in their
    native language [@Goto1971; @Miyawaki1975].  Long-term naturalistic exposure
    is not sufficient to achieve good discrimination of this contrast, even
    after convserational competence has been achieved [@Takagi1995].  While
    perception of this contrast can be improved somewhat by training, it
    requries extensive training and these listeners seldom achieve native-like
    levels of performance [@Bradlow1997].

    There are also apparent constraints on the ability of adult listeners to
    adapt to variations in the distributions associated with native language
    categories.  For instance, @Idemaru2011 tested how well listeners adapt to
    distributions of two cues that distinguish voicing (e.g., /b/ vs. /p/),
    voice onset time (VOT, the primary cue to voicing) and the pitch of the
    following vowel (f0, a secondary cue).  These two cues are typically
    positively correlated in English, with /p/ corresponding to high VOT and
    high f0, and /b/ to low values of both cues [@Kohler1982]. In one condition,
    listeners were exposed to a talker who produced a positively correlated
    distribution of these cues. During a post-test, these listeners used f0 to
    categorize stops with ambiguous VOTs. In another condition, listeners heard
    a talker who produced an *un*correlated distribution, where f0 is
    uninformative. In contrast to the listeners in the first condition, during
    the post test these listeners _ignored_ f0 even for ambiguous VOTs. This
    effect is consistent with the idea that listeners are rationally integrating
    multiple cues to voicing, weighing them based on how informative they are
    [@Ernst2004; @Clayards2008; @Bejjanki2011]. However, listeners in a third
    condition who were exposed to a talker who produced an *anti*correlated
    distribution did _not_ follow the predictions of rational cue integration.
    Despite the fact that f0 was just as informative for this accent as for the
    positively correlated accent, listeners _ignored_ f0 as a cue to
    voicing. This suggests that these listeners have ruled out the possibility
    of a reversed mapping between f0 and voicing (/b/ vs. /p/), possibly perhaps
    American English talkers typically do not typically produce it [e.g.,
    @House1953].  Likewise, @Sumner2011 found that listeners had trouble
    adapting to a talker who produced VOT distributions for /b/ and /p/ that had
    _substantially_ lower means (approximately -60ms and 0ms, respectively) than
    a typical talker [approximately 0--10ms and 60ms VOT; @Lisker1964].

*** goals: systematically probe constraints on distributional learning 
    So on the one hand, distributional learning provides a unifying theoretical
    perspective on flexibility in language acquisition and adaptation.  On the
    other hand, it highlights an important difference between these two basic
    kinds of plasticity in the language system.  From the lens of distributional
    learning, one major difference between acquisition and adaptation is that
    distributional learning in adulthood appears to be /constrained/, while it
    is relatively /unconstrained/ during acquisition.

    However, we lack a clear understanding of the nature and source of those
    constraints.  There are a number of other differences between the learning
    problems posed by acquisition and adaptation, even if both are forms of
    distributional learning.  First, distributional learning in infancy is, at
    least initially, almost entirely unsupervised, meaning that there is very
    little information about whether any two observed acoustic cue values come
    from the same cluster (category) or different ones.  Adults have a great
    deal of circumstantial evidence from the lexicon, pragmatic context,
    phonotactics, etc. which provides /some/ information about the intended
    category for a particular cue value.  This makes the distributional 
    problem of adaptation at least semi-supervised.  
    # where does the constraint come from here?
    Second, when adapting to an
    unfamiliar talker, adults have a great deal of prior experience with /other/
    talkers which they could use to narrow down the possible distributions they
    ought to expect [@Kleinschmidt2015].  Both of these factors might contribute
    to constraints on adult distributional learning.  For the first, if adult
    adaptation typically operates in a /supervised/ setting, the fully
    unsupervised setting of a typical distributional learning experiment might
    not provide enough information, leading to reduced learning.  For the
    second, if the distributions encountered in an experiment fall far enough
    outside the range of what a listener expects based on their prior
    experience, they may struggle to adapt [@Kleinschmidt2015].

    The goal of this paper is to systematically probe the constraints on
    distributional learning in American English-speaking adults.  Experiment 1
    tests the ability of American English listeners to change their
    classification of word initial stop voicing based on experience with a range
    of distributions of voice-onset time (VOT).  I find that distributional
    learning is more complete when the experimental distributions are more
    similar to those of a typical American English talker, suggesting that prior
    experience with other talkers may constrain distributional learning.
    Experiment 2 tests another possible constraint on distributional learning,
    which is the absence of /labels/, which could lead to uncertainty about
    whether the bimodal distribution really corresponds to the standard English
    categories of voiced and voiceless stops of /b/ and /p/.  Surprisingly,
    telling listeners whether a particular VOT was intended to be a voiced /b/
    or a voiceless /p/ on half of the trials has no effect on the speed or
    completeness of distributional learning.  Experiment 3 uses a Bayesian
    belief-updating model to test whether the constraints observed in Experiment
    1 can be explained as belief updating starting from a common set of prior
    beliefs that is shared by all of the subjects.

    Together, these results show that distributional learning in adults /is/
    constrained, and these constraints are at least consistent with belief
    updating starting from a set of prior beliefs about the VOT distributions
    that a typical talker of American English will produce.
    
**** preview
     Developmental trajectory may better be thought of as a *change* in the kind
     of flexibility that listeners have, rather than a *loss* of plasticity.

*** need to balance stability and flexibility
    if you are too stable, can't deal with changes (e.g., unfamiliar talkers and
    accents).  but if you're too flexible, then you end up overly sensitive to
    meaningless variation that doesn't predict what's going to happen in the
    future.

    I think this is better for the *discussion*: why are these constraints
    there?  For the introduction we want at most to gesture towards this
    story...

** for discussion
   are these results anti-bayesian?  no...learning is inference, guided by prior
   experience.
